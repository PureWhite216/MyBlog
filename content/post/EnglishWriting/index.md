This article is the note of my English course in Grade 1, which concentrates on `Thesis Statement` and `Six Principle of Academic Writing`.
<!--more-->

## Thesis Statement, the Core of Academic Writing
Thesis Statement should clearly demonstrate authorâ€™s position, which means one aspect most overwhelms the other one, and there should be only one idea in TS.

#### Example
Because the Internet is filled with tremendous marketing potential, companies should exploit this potential by using web pages that offer both advertising and customer support.

## Six Principle of Academic Writing
### Objecivity
1. State natural and social phenomena which exist objectively 
2. Observation experiment description analysis and discussion
3. Avoid personal emotion and subjective assumption
4. Non-verbal expressions such as data, symbol, chart, and table are furthest int contrast colloquial expressions are forbidden.
5. The first and the second person are avoided and the passive voice is preferred.
6. Informal abbreviations that are typical of spoken language are not used.
7. Neutral and impersonal words are advocated in order to shun personal emotion effectively.

### Explicitness
#### Use Signal Words
##### Example1
**Moreover**, NMR has become an proven instrument for metabolic and structural studies in biology
##### Example2
**However**, a serious and partly insurmountable obstacle for superconducting magnets is the critical magnetic field that can be achieved without loss of the superconductivity.
(The idea is different from the former one)
#### Logical Conjunctions
1. `Undertake relationships`: also, and, first, second, third.
2. `Space`: near (to), far(from), in front of behind, beyond above.
3. `Time`: now, then
4. `Comparison`: in the same way, just like, just at
5. `Transition`: but, still, yet, however, nevertheless, on the contrary.
6. `Stress`: in fact, indeed, surely, necessarily, certainly, above all
7. `Results and reasons`: because, since, so, as a result, then, thus, otherwise,
8. `Explanation`: for example, in fact, in the case, for actually, for instance
9. `For this reason`, for this purpose, so that.
10. `Summary`: in a word, above all,  all in all, finally, at last, in conclusion

### Complexity
1. complicated sentence pattern
2. nominalization
3. lexical complexity.

#### Example
Hence, it is not strange that (1)the interventional cardiologists had to face (3)unknown problems (2)emerging during their initial applications such as the late recoil (2)caused by the fast absorption of the scaffold the focal mechanical failure and the difficulties (2)noted in (2)controlling the drug release.
