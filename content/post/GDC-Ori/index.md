## Visual Storytelling
### Developing a Consistnet Visual Vocabulary for a Sequence
#### Direction indicates Theme
1. **Left** = `the past`, `security`, or `what is known`
2. **Right** = `the future`, `uncentainty`, or `the unknown`
##### Example

>In the beginng, Ori is beckoned by Gumo to the cave on the left, which is an familiar from the first game, as if returning to the past.

![](2.JPG)
>Then ori exits the cave and a big seasonal montage begins, where we have sweeping camera with a strong rightward momentum.

>The narration tells player that the answer to help Ku lay in the past, so Ori returns back to the left.

>Once retrieved the item, Ori backs right to Ku. Then we begin the journey into will of the wisps.

#### Seasonal Montage

Create a balance between what is nostalgic and what is new.
The montage takes player back to the familiar scenes in blind forest.

### Getting Value from 15 Seconds
1. Each action adds new information
2. Develops character bonds
3. Tells a small, encapsulated story
4. Works as a step in a larger story

### Flight Sequence - Blend of 3 Ideas
1. A daytime transition(from dawn to darkness): More visual variety
2. The mastery of flight
3. A goodbye letter to Nibel
The combination creates a unique sequence
